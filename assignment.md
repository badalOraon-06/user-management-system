Project Title
Mini User Management System
Assessment Brief
Build a User Management System a web application that manages user accounts with different roles and permissions. The system must support user authentication, role-based authorization, and basic user lifecycle management. This assessment evaluates your understanding of authentication flows, API security, role-based access control (RBAC), and clean architectural patterns.
Assessment Overview
This is a 48-hour timed assessment designed to evaluate your full-stack development skills across backend, frontend, database design, API development, business logic implementation, UI/UX, and deployment

6. Deliverables
1.
GitHub Repository (Frontend & Backend)

o
All sensitive credentials must be stored in .env files and excluded from the repository using .gitignore.
o
The repository must be public so the review panel can access it without special permissions.
2.
Live Deployment Links
o
Frontend Deployment: Must be hosted on Vercel, Netlify, or equivalent.
o
Backend Deployment: Must be hosted on Render, Railway, AWS, or equivalent, and accessible via public API endpoints.
o
Database: Must be cloud-hosted (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, Neon/PostgreSQL).
o
All URLs for deployed applications (frontend, backend, API docs) must be clearly listed in the README.
3.
README File (Setup Instructions & Tech Stack)
o
A comprehensive README file in Markdown format.
o
Must include:
▪
Project Overview — what the application does and its purpose.

▪
API Documentation — list of available endpoints with request/response examples.
4.
Screen-Recorded Walkthrough Video (3 – 5 minutes)

▪
User login & role-based access control in action.
▪
Creating, editing, and deleting tasks.
▪
AI simulation feature generating summaries and tags.
▪

▪
How the app looks and works on both desktop & mobile views.
▪
Quick backend API demonstration (using Postman or browser).
